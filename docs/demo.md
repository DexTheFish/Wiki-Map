## Conclusions

Calvin:
  -talk about geolocation Stretch
  -our approach to problem was to build out the flow and datastructure of the app before we connected the map 
  -one of the biggest challenges was to convert our location data into actual points on a map in terms of latlong
  -we knew that that wouldn't be the most convenient way to add points so as a stretch feature we really wanted to have a search feature that would geocode the latlong for us
Dex:
  -git workflow, scheduling,

Abi:
  - features we would love to add
  - turning it into a single page and making the page more dynamic
  
  - vertical vs horizontal
  - things we want to add
  - we are really proud of our app. Thanks for your time! Goodbye!



- stretch features we were proud of:
  - geolocation
- challenges:
  - teamwork / git workflow
  - scheduling around a team
- lessons learned:
  - COMMIT, COMMIT, COMMIT! PUSH PUSH PUSH!
  - modularity
  - planning
  - needs vertical workflow
  - good naming practices


Challenges, lessons learned, stretches
