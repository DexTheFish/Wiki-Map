## Lessons Learned
it was a challenge to manage git workflow, particularly choosing good branches and consistently doing work on proper branches


## User Stories

- As a user, I can see a list of the available maps based on some category
- As a user, I can see all points on a map 
- As a user, when I select a point, I can see some details about that point:
  * Title,
  * Description
  * Image
  * Creator (stretch)
  * Rating (stretch)
  * Like counter (stretch)
  * Like counter with who (stretch)
  * Bookmark a specific location (stretch)
- As a user, I can bookmark a map (eg. I like to eat, so I'll bookmark restos)
- As an authenticated user, I can create a (blank) map
- As an authenticated user, I can modify a map of points (CUD) that belong to a common category
- As a user, I can have a profile of my favourite:
  * Maps
  * Points (stretch)
- As a user I can have a profile that shows maps that I have contributed to
- As a user I can have a profile that shows maps that I have authored (created)

"Map" = a location and points in that location

### From Compass:
Option 1: Wiki Map
A web app that allows users to collaboratively create maps which list multiple "points". For example: "Best Places to Eat Around Town" or "Locations of Movie Scenes".
Requirements:
	• users can view a map
	• a map can contain many points
	• each point can have: a title, description, and image
	• authenticated users can create maps
	• authenticated users can modify maps (add, edit, remove points)
	• users can favourite a map
	• users have profiles, indicating their favourite maps and maps they've contributed to
	• use  http://leafletjs.com/ or  https://developers.google.com/maps/
